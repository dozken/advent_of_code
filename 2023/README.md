This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges for the year 2023. Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles released throughout December.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. The challenges cover a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and more. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants are encouraged to solve it using their programming skills.
